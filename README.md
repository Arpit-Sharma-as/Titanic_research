# Titanic Dataset Machine Learning Model

This repository contains the code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict survival on the Titanic.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which includes information about passengers on the Titanic and whether they survived or not.

Dataset source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## Contents
- `titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files (train.csv and test.csv).
- `models/`: Directory to store trained machine learning models.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for this project.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-model.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `titanic.ipynb` to analyze the data and build the model.
4. Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters for better performance.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
